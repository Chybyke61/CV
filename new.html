    <h2>DESCRIPTION OF GRAPHICS DESIGN</h2>
    <p>Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, color, page layout, and illustration. It is one of the most powerful tools for expressing ideas and conveying messages, and it is used in all sorts of media from print to digital. As a graphic designer, you have the opportunity to create something beautiful and meaningful that can be used in a variety of ways to reach different audiences. </p>
<h2>The Role of Graphic Designers</h2>
<p> Graphic designers are responsible for creating visual solutions to problems. They must understand the context of the problem and come up with a suitable design that communicates the message effectively. They must consider the audience, the medium, and the message, and create something that will capture the attention of that audience. Graphic designers are also responsible for managing the production of the design, ensuring that it meets the standards of the client and is printed correctly.</p>

 <p>Freepik is an image bank website. Content produced and distributed by the online platform includes photographs, illustrations and vector images. The platform distributes its content under a freemium model, which means that users can access much of the content for free, but it is also possible to purchase a subscription with advantages such as access to more exclusive resources, the option of not attributing the content used or a higher number of daily downloads.[1]

Freepik was founded in 2010 in Malaga[2] with the idea of providing free graphic resources to designers around the world. The Spanish stock image platform is used by several million users, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freepik#cite_note-2">multinationals</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freepik#cite_note-2">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freepik#cite_note-2">FedEx</a>, Amazon or Spotify.[1]

The platform is part of the Freepik Company, a company that has been chosen by the Financial Times as one of the thirty fastest growing companies on the European continent. Freepik Company is the parent brand of four other creative platforms: Flaticon, Slidesgo, Storyset[3][4] and Wepik.[5]

The content of Freepik Company products is created by the company's designers[6][7] and its more than 21,000 collaborators of more than 100 countries, and downloads of its content reach an average of more than 80 million per month.

In 2020 the Swedish investment firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freepik#cite_note-2">EQT</a>[8] acquired a majority stake in Freepik Company.[9]

In 2022 Freepik was named in G2's Best Software 2022 Awards, ranking 17th on the list of best-selling software in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 43rd in the list of best design products.[10]</p>
